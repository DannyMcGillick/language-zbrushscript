# language-zbrushscript

A package for Atom offering syntax hilighting and API snippets for ZBrush's ZScript language. Ported from Sublime_ZScript by Siu Yi Liang. Recognises .zs extention.

## Install

Copy language-zbrushscript to /User/YourUser/.atom/packages. If you already have a zbrush script open, close and reopen the folder.

## Known Issues
Functions no arguments: always pick the args version. I need to handle those better.

## Todo
Add a thingy to export .txt files.
Add a thingy to export .txt file to a target Zbrush ZStartup/Macros/Whatever folder if you don't like working there.
